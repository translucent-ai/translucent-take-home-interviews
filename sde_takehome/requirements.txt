# Standard Python libraries only - no external dependencies required
# This keeps the take-home simple and focused on core programming skills

# The baseline implementation uses only Python standard library:
# - json (for data serialization)
# - re (for regex pattern matching)
# - collections (for efficient data structures)
# - datetime (for timestamp handling)
# - statistics (for statistical calculations)
# - argparse (for command-line interface)

# Candidates may choose to use additional libraries, but the baseline
# should work with just the standard library to ensure compatibility.
