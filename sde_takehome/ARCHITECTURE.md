# Pipeline Monitoring System Architecture

## Design Decisions

### Data Structures
- **Choice**: Implemented circular buffers (fixed-size lists) for time-series data like durations and throughput
- **Trade-offs**: 
  - Fixed-size history provides constant memory usage while maintaining recent trends
  - Chose lists over numpy arrays for simplicity and lower memory overhead
  - Alternative considered: Time-series database would be better for production but overkill here

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Approach**: Multi-dimensional health tracking with statistical analysis
- **Metrics**: 
  - Success rate: Primary indicator of pipeline reliability
  - Duration statistics: Detect performance degradation
  - Throughput: Records processed per second
  - Failure patterns: Consecutive failures detection

### Anomaly Detection
- **Algorithm**: Statistical analysis using z-scores for continuous metrics
- **Thresholds**: 
  - Success rate < 80%: Medium severity
  - Success rate < 50%: High severity
  - Duration > 2 std deviations: Medium severity
  - Duration > 3 std deviations: High severity
  - Throughput drop > 50%: High severity
- **Severity Levels**: Based on impact and urgency
  - Critical: Multiple consecutive failures
  - High: Severe performance degradation
  - Medium: Minor anomalies
  - Low: Informational alerts

### Alerting System
- **Routing**: Team-based routing using pipeline ownership metadata
- **Deduplication**: 
  - 1-hour cooldown window for similar alerts
  - Alert comparison based on severity and message content
- **Escalation**: 
  - Automatic severity escalation for repeated failures
  - Critical alerts for pattern-based anomalies

## Scaling Considerations

### Real-time Processing
- **Streaming**: How would you handle real-time pipeline event streams?
- **Event Processing**: What event processing architecture would you use?
- **State Management**: How would you maintain pipeline state across distributed systems?

### Large Scale (1000+ pipelines)
- **Distributed Monitoring**: How would you distribute monitoring across multiple services?
- **Storage**: What storage solution would you choose for pipeline metrics?
- **Query Performance**: How would you enable fast queries across large datasets?

### Multi-Team Architecture
- **Team Isolation**: How would you ensure teams only see their pipeline data?
- **Cross-Team Dependencies**: How would you handle pipelines that span multiple teams?
- **Permission Management**: How would you implement access controls?

### High Availability
- **Fault Tolerance**: How would you ensure monitoring doesn't fail when pipelines fail?
- **Redundancy**: What redundancy strategies would you implement?
- **Recovery**: How would you handle monitoring system failures?

## Trade-offs Considered

### Accuracy vs Performance

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term (1-3 months)
- [What improvements would you make in the short term?]
- [What additional metrics would you add?]

### Long Term (6+ months)
- [What architectural changes would you consider for long-term scalability?]
- [How would you integrate with existing monitoring tools?]

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- [How would this integrate with your current data pipeline infrastructure?]
- [What APIs would you expose for other systems?]

### External Tools
- [How would you integrate with alerting systems (PagerDuty, Slack)?]
- [What dashboard tools would you support?]
