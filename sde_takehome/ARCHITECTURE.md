# Pipeline Monitoring System Architecture

## Design Decisions

### Data Structures
- **Choice**: [Describe your choice of data structures for storing pipeline metrics and execution data]
- **Trade-offs**: [What alternatives did you consider? Memory vs speed considerations?]

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Approach**: [How did you implement pipeline health tracking?]
- **Metrics**: [What key metrics do you track and why?]

### Anomaly Detection
- **Algorithm**: [What method did you use for detecting pipeline anomalies?]
- **Thresholds**: [How did you determine what constitutes an anomaly?]
- **Severity Levels**: [How do you classify alert severity?]

### Alerting System
- **Routing**: [How do you route alerts to appropriate teams?]
- **Deduplication**: [How do you prevent alert spam?]
- **Escalation**: [How do you handle escalating alerts?]

## Scaling Considerations

### Real-time Processing
- **Streaming**: How would you handle real-time pipeline event streams?
- **Event Processing**: What event processing architecture would you use?
- **State Management**: How would you maintain pipeline state across distributed systems?

### Large Scale (1000+ pipelines)
- **Distributed Monitoring**: How would you distribute monitoring across multiple services?
- **Storage**: What storage solution would you choose for pipeline metrics?
- **Query Performance**: How would you enable fast queries across large datasets?

### Multi-Team Architecture
- **Team Isolation**: How would you ensure teams only see their pipeline data?
- **Cross-Team Dependencies**: How would you handle pipelines that span multiple teams?
- **Permission Management**: How would you implement access controls?

### High Availability
- **Fault Tolerance**: How would you ensure monitoring doesn't fail when pipelines fail?
- **Redundancy**: What redundancy strategies would you implement?
- **Recovery**: How would you handle monitoring system failures?

## Trade-offs Considered

### Accuracy vs Performance
- [Describe trade-offs between monitoring accuracy and system performance]

### Storage vs Speed
- [Describe trade-offs between data storage and query performance]

### Real-time vs Batch
- [Describe trade-offs between real-time monitoring and batch processing]

### Granularity vs Overhead
- [Describe trade-offs between detailed monitoring and system overhead]

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term (1-3 months)
- [What improvements would you make in the short term?]
- [What additional metrics would you add?]

### Long Term (6+ months)
- [What architectural changes would you consider for long-term scalability?]
- [How would you integrate with existing monitoring tools?]

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- [How would this integrate with your current data pipeline infrastructure?]
- [What APIs would you expose for other systems?]

### External Tools
- [How would you integrate with alerting systems (PagerDuty, Slack)?]
- [What dashboard tools would you support?]
